Project Overview
This project aims to have students implement a lightweight version of Git that tracks changes
to files, supports commits, branching, merging, and log history â€” all from scratch, without using
external version control libraries.
The system will simulate a local-only Git-like experience via command-line operations. It will
also help students understand how real-world systems (like Git) are underpinned by DSA
principles such as hashing, trees, DAGs, and file diffing.
